### Google-Interview-Preparation-Guide

## Books and References

## Basic data structures and algorithms
1. Programming pearls by Jon Bently
2. The algorithm design manual by Skiena
3. Introduction to algorithms by Cormen
4. Data Structures and algorithms by Robert Lafore

## For Technical Preparation
1. Cracking the coding Interview
2. Programming interviews exposed
3. Elements of Programming interview in Java

## Online channels and Websites
Limiting the amount of sources. Its better to have couple of hardcopy books and many online sources to complete different questions.
1. MIT open courseware
2. HackerEarth
3. Hackerrank


## Before we head into the main details regarding the topics it is highly recommended to practice each and every question, algorithms on paper instead of using an IDE.
